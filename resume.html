            <h2>EXPERIENCE : </br></h2>
            CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GRILL
            McDonald's , Vancouver , Washington / Jun 2019 - Present
            â€¢ I work in the kitchen preparing food and at the front counter helping customers through the ordering process. Team member job duties include operating a cash register, running the drive-thru, cooking Big Macs and other menu items, cleaning the restaurant, and completing other assigned tasks. Well, I am a grill member as well. I open grill, so I have to be in work at like 4:00 in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays. I typically work the weekends, weekdays too over the summer. Typical job duties with opening, I go in, I have to take all the stock, put it into freezers, make sure that the meat is at a proper temperature, make sure that it's safe to consume, everything for the table, which is where you would prepare the sandwiches is out and ready to go by the time the store opens, food's ready to be made into sandwiches. Yeah. What else? Also, some heavy lifting, not heavy, but 50 pounds or lighter.</br></br>
